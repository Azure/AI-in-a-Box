## What's in this box?

This deployment template contains a minimal Landing Zone configuration that enables:

- Cognitive services that implement a wide range of Natural Language functionality, including Azure OpenAI, Document Intelligence and AI Search;
- Hub-and-Spoke network configuration;
- Private endpoint connectivity between Azure services;
- DNS Resolver and Private DNS Zones to enable domain name resolution within the Vnets;
- App Services with Vnet integration to host custom applications which rely on Cognitive Services.
