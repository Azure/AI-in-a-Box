# Custom Vision Edge in-a-box

![Banner](/media/images/banner-customvision-edge-in-a-box.png)

In real-time decision scenarios with cloud latency challenges, Edge AI enables us to shift analysis closer to the data source, extracting responsive results. These advantages are exemplified in the architecture below. In this accelerator, we aim to demonstrate how easy it is to leverage [Custom Vision](https://www.customvision.ai/)  for training a classification model and exporting it to a specific format, such as ONNX or a Dockerfile, ready for deployment to an edge container.

## MOVED

We have moved the solution to a new repository. Please visit the new repository [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/customvision-edge-in-a-box](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/customvision-edge-in-a-box).
